# Tempo
Tempo is a hobby project built really quickly to help me track my habits and keep on tempo with them.

## Thesis
Large progress is the culmination of directed movement that results in momentum. The key to momentum is maintaining *tempo*!

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
